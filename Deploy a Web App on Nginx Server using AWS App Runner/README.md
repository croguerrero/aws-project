# Key Concepts for AWS App Runner

AWS App Runner is a fully managed service that makes it easy to build, deploy, and scale containerized applications quickly. Here are some key concepts to understand when working with AWS App Runner:

1. **App**: An app in AWS App Runner represents your containerized application. It includes the source code, dependencies, and configuration needed to run your application.

2. **Service**: A service is an instance of your app running in AWS App Runner. It is automatically created when you deploy your app and can be scaled up or down based on demand.

3. **Deployment**: A deployment is the process of taking your app's source code and dependencies and creating a running service in AWS App Runner. You can deploy your app from a source code repository, a container image, or a Dockerfile.

4. **Environment**: An environment is a set of configuration values that define how your app runs in AWS App Runner. It includes settings such as the CPU and memory allocation, network configuration, and environment variables.

5. **Domain**: A domain is a custom URL that you can associate with your app in AWS App Runner. It allows you to access your app using a user-friendly domain name instead of the default AWS App Runner URL.

6. **Auto Scaling**: AWS App Runner automatically scales your app based on the incoming traffic. It can scale up or down the number of service instances based on predefined rules and metrics.

7. **Logs**: AWS App Runner provides logs that capture information about the deployment and runtime of your app. You can access these logs to troubleshoot issues and monitor the performance of your app.

8. **VPC**: AWS App Runner can be deployed in a VPC to provide network isolation and security for your app. You can configure the VPC settings for your app to control inbound and outbound traffic.

9. **Monitoring**: AWS App Runner integrates with Amazon CloudWatch to provide monitoring and alerting capabilities for your app. You can set up alarms and dashboards to track the performance and health of your app.
